Lab 2:
converter.py: receives 3 letter codons and prints corresponding amino acids
coordinateMathSoln.py: receives coordinates in n space of alpha carbon, n terminal nitrogen, and c terminal carbon of amino acid and prints relevant bond lengths/angles.
fastqParse.py: recieves fastafile and prints sequencing instrument ID and sequencing parameters
seqCleaner.py: receives a DNA sequence with n unknown bases and returns the original sequence with {n} in place of the unknown bases

Lab 3: 
proteinParams.py: receives a single letter amino acid sequence and outputs number of residues, molar mass, molar/mass extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, and amino acid composition percentages
